### Nice to meet you!

Hello, I'm Zhenlin Zhu, a Chinese girl born in Sichuan.
Thanks to my dad who bought the first telescope at home, I was obsessed with the stunning night sky since childhood. Following my curiosity in the stars and universe, I did my bachelor and master in Department of Astronomy and Space Science at Nanjing University. After that, I went to Netherlands and continued my journey at Leiden University to get my PhD. I worked at Netherlands Institute for Space Research (SRON) for 5 years, focusing on the X-ray emission of galaxy clusters.   

### From Astronomy to Data Science & Machine Learning

Throughout my research career, I worked extensively with large-scale astronomical datasets, advanced statistical modeling, and coding skills that seamlessly translate into data science, machine learning, and quantitative research. From analyzing terabytes of observational data to developing predictive models, I’ve honed expertise in Python, R, SQL, statistical modeling, A/B testing, and story-telling skills.

Currently, as a postdoc working at UCLA, I independently design methodologies, work with heterogenous unstructured data, and build analytical frameworks to answer complex questions. 
As my personal interest gradually shifts to AI in recent years, I decided to explore exciting opportunities in industry. I gained hands-on industry experience from my internship as a Machine Learning Engineer and accomplished multiple projects ranging from classification to Generative AI. I believe my thoughts and skills trained in academia can be a good match to many statistical roles in the domain of finance and tech. 

### In Life

Grown up in Asia, had my PhD degree in Europe, and now I'm in US. Life took me around the world and made me a qualified global citizen. I enjoy working in the multi-cutural environment and making friends from each corner on earth. I like various kinds of sports, swimming, hiking, volleyball and pickaball are my favorite. I love fluffy things, especially my 5-year-old ragdoll cat Cocoa. Science is charming, life is equally important.
