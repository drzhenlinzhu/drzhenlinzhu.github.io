### 👋 Nice to meet you!

Hello, I'm Zhenlin Zhu, a Chinese girl born in Sichuan.
Thanks to my dad who bought the first telescope at home, I was obsessed with the stunning night sky since childhood. 
Driven by this passion, I pursued my bachelor’s and master’s degrees in the Department of Astronomy and Space Science at Nanjing University. I later moved to the Netherlands to continue my academic journey at Leiden University, where I earned my PhD. During this time, I worked at the Netherlands Institute for Space Research (SRON) for five years, focusing on the X-ray emission of galaxy clusters.
I’m now based in California, working as a postdoctoral researcher at UCLA.

### 🚀 From Astronomy to Data Science & Machine Learning

Throughout my research career, I worked extensively with large-scale astronomical datasets, advanced statistical modeling, and coding skills that seamlessly translate into data science, machine learning, and quantitative research. From analyzing terabytes of observational data to building predictive models, I have developed strong expertise in Python, R, SQL, statistical modeling, A/B testing, and data storytelling. As a postdoc at UCLA, I independently design research methodologies, work with heterogeneous and unstructured data, and build analytical frameworks to tackle complex scientific questions.

In recent years, my interests have increasingly shifted toward AI and machine learning. Motivated by this transition, I actively explored industry applications through a concise internship as a Machine Learning Engineer and completed multiple hands-on projects ranging from traditional classification tasks to Generative AI systems. I believe the rigorous thinking, problem-solving mindset, and quantitative training developed in academia make me well suited for data-driven roles in technology and finance.

### 🌍 Life beyond Research

Having grown up in Asia, completed my PhD in Europe, and now living in the United States, I’ve been fortunate to experience life across cultures. This journey has shaped me into a truly global citizen who enjoys working in multicultural environments and connecting with people from all over the world.

Outside of work, I love staying active—swimming, hiking, volleyball, and pickleball are my favorites. I also have a soft spot for fluffy companions, especially my 5-year-old ragdoll cat, Cocoa. Science is endlessly fascinating, but I believe life beyond research is just as important.
